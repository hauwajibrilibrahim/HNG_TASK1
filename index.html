            <h2>My Tech Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Over the next two years, I have set several ambitious goals to advance my career in the tech field. Firstly, I plan to deepen my expertise in front-end development, particularly focusing on ReactJS, as it is a powerful and widely-used library for building user interfaces. I aim to master advanced concepts and best practices in ReactJS, enabling me to build more efficient and scalable web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I will dive deeper into back-end development with Node.js. My goal is to become proficient in building robust server-side applications and APIs. This will complement my front-end skills and make me a more versatile developer capable of handling full-stack projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also intend to contribute to open-source projects regularly. This will not only help me give back to the community but also expose me to diverse codebases and collaborative workflows, enhancing my coding skills and teamwork abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I am eager to explore advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly their integration in web development. I believe that understanding and applying these technologies will open up new and exciting possibilities for creating smarter and more intuitive web applications.
